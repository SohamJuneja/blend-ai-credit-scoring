          How Your Credit Score Works
        </Typography>
        Your score is calculated using a sophisticated 7-factor algorithm that analyzes your
        on-chain behavior, repayment history, and risk management patterns. Higher scores unlock
        better lending terms including lower interest rates, higher LTV ratios, and access to
        premium DeFi products.
